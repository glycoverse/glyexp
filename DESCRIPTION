Description: Provides a tidy data framework for managing glycoproteomics and
    glycomics experimental data. The core feature is the 'experiment()' class,
    which serves as a unified data container integrating expression matrices,
    variable information (proteins, peptides, glycan compositions, etc.), and
    sample metadata (groups, batches, clinical variables, etc.). The package
    enforces data consistency, validates column types according to experiment
    types (glycomics, glycoproteomics, traitomics, traitproteomics), and
    provides dplyr-style data manipulation functions (filter, mutate, select,
    arrange, slice, join) for seamless data wrangling. As the data core of
    the 'glycoverse' ecosystem, it provides a consistent interface that other
    packages can reliably extract information from, enabling smooth data
    exchange and analysis workflows.
