\title{Find the original user function call from the call stack}
\usage{
find_user_call(
  user_functions = c("mutate_samples", "mutate_variables", "select_samples",
    "select_variables", "rename_samples", "rename_variables", "filter_samples",
    "filter_variables")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{user_functions}{A character vector of function names to search for
in the call stack. Defaults to common dplyr-style functions in glyexp.}
}
\value{
The first matching call found in the stack, or the result of
\code{rlang::caller_call()} if no match is found.
}
\description{
This function searches through the call stack to find calls to user-facing
functions like mutate_samples, select_samples, etc. It's used to provide
better error messages that show the correct function name rather than
internal helper function names.
