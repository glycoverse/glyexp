Welcome to the world of **synchronized data manipulation**! 🎼

If you've ever worked with multi-table datasets, 
you know the pain: 
filter one table, 
and suddenly your data is out of sync. 
Rearrange another, 
and your carefully crafted relationships crumble like a house of cards.

**Enter glyexp's dplyr-style functions** - your new data harmony conductors! 🎯

These aren't just regular dplyr functions with a fancy wrapper. 
They're **relationship-aware data manipulators** specifically designed for `glyexp::experiment()` objects that understand the intricate dance between your expression matrix, 
sample information, 
and variable annotations. 
When you transform one piece, 
everything else follows in perfect synchronization.

**🎯 Important Note:** These functions **only work with `experiment()` objects** - you cannot use them on regular data.frames, 
tibbles, 
or other data structures. 
They are purpose-built for the synchronized data model that `experiment()` provides.

```{r setup}
library(glyexp)
library(dplyr)
library(conflicted)

conflicts_prefer(glyexp::select_var)
conflicts_prefer(dplyr::filter)
```

## The Core Philosophy: One Action, Three Updates 🎭

Imagine you're the conductor of a three-piece orchestra:

🎼 **First violin (Expression Matrix)**: Your numerical data  
🎼 **Second violin (Sample Info)**: Your experimental metadata  
🎼 **Viola (Variable Info)**: Your molecular annotations  

In traditional data analysis, 
when you want the first violin to play a solo (filter samples), 
you have to manually cue each instrument. 
Miss a beat, 
and your symphony turns into chaos.

**glyexp's dplyr-style functions are different.** 
They're like having a magical conductor's baton - 
wave it once, 
and all three instruments respond in perfect harmony!

Let's see this magic in action:

```{r}
toy_exp <- toy_experiment
print(toy_exp)
```

## The Two Flavors: `_obs()` and `_var()` 🍦

Every dplyr-style function in glyexp comes in two delicious flavors:

- **`_obs()` functions**: Work on sample information (observations/columns) in `experiment()` objects
- **`_var()` functions**: Work on variable annotations (variables/rows) in `experiment()` objects

But here's the beautiful part - **both flavors automatically update the expression matrix** to maintain perfect synchronization!

**⚠️ Reminder:** These specialized functions require an `experiment()` object as input and return an `experiment()` object as output. 
They cannot be used with standard tibbles or data.frames - for those, 
use the regular dplyr functions directly.

### Filtering: The Art of Selective Attention 🔍

Let's start with the most common operation - filtering your data.

#### Sample-Based Filtering with `filter_obs()`

Say you want to focus only on group "A" samples:

```{r}
# Before filtering - let's see what we have
get_sample_info(toy_exp)
```

```{r}
# Filter for group A samples only
filtered_exp <- filter_obs(toy_exp, group == "A")
get_sample_info(filtered_exp)
```

**Beautiful!** But here's where the magic happens - check the expression matrix:

```{r}
# Original matrix dimensions:
dim(get_expr_mat(toy_exp))

# Original matrix:
get_expr_mat(toy_exp)
```

```{r}
# Filtered expression matrix - automatically updated!

# Filtered matrix dimensions:
dim(get_expr_mat(filtered_exp))

# Filtered matrix:
get_expr_mat(filtered_exp)
```

🎪 **Ta-da!** The expression matrix automatically filtered its columns to match the remaining samples! 
No manual intervention, 
no risk of mismatched data - 
just pure, 
synchronized harmony.

#### Variable-Based Filtering with `filter_var()`

Now let's filter variables and watch the same magic happen:

```{r}
# Filter for specific glycan compositions
var_filtered_exp <- filter_var(toy_exp, glycan_composition == "H5N2")
get_var_info(var_filtered_exp)
```

```{r}
# The expression matrix rows automatically follow suit!
get_expr_mat(var_filtered_exp)
```

**The matrix rows automatically reduced to match the filtered variables!** 
This is the core power of glyexp - 
you think about your metadata, 
and the expression data follows your lead.

#### Chaining Filters: The Symphony Continues 🎵

Want to filter both samples and variables? 
Chain them together like a beautiful melody:

```{r}
double_filtered <- toy_exp |>
  filter_obs(group == "A") |>
  filter_var(glycan_composition %in% c("H5N2", "N3N2"))

# Final dimensions after double filtering:
dim(get_expr_mat(double_filtered))
get_expr_mat(double_filtered)
```

**Notice the pipe-friendly design?** 
That's the dplyr DNA in action - 
familiar syntax, 
powerful results!

## The Sacred Index Columns: Guardians of Data Integrity 🛡️

Here's where glyexp really shines: 
**index column protection**. 
These special columns (like "sample" and "variable") are the backbone of your data relationships. 
Lose them, 
and your carefully orchestrated data symphony falls apart.

Let's see this protection in action:

### Attempting to Remove Index Columns (Spoiler: It Won't Work!) 😄

```{r error=TRUE}
# Try to select everything EXCEPT the sample index column
protective_exp <- select_obs(toy_exp, -sample)
get_sample_info(protective_exp)
```

**Did you see that error message?** 
glyexp throws a helpful error message and protects our data integrity by preventing this operation entirely!

```{r error=TRUE}
# Same protection for variable info
protective_var_exp <- select_var(toy_exp, -variable)
get_var_info(protective_var_exp)
```

Similarly, glyexp throws an error to protect the "variable" column from being removed! 🏰

### Why This Protection Matters

Without index columns, 
your `experiment()` object would lose its ability to:

- ✅ Keep expression matrix and metadata synchronized
- ✅ Validate data consistency
- ✅ Enable seamless subsetting operations
- ✅ Work with other `glycoverse` packages

Think of index columns as the **GPS coordinates** of your data - 
remove them, 
and you're lost in a sea of unconnected numbers!

## The Complete Function Family Tree 🌳

glyexp provides dplyr-style equivalents for all your favorite data manipulation functions. 
**Each function comes in both `_obs()` and `_var()` flavors**, 
and **all automatically maintain matrix synchronization**.

**🔧 Technical Note:** All these functions are **methods specifically for `experiment()` objects**. 
Unlike generic dplyr functions that work on various data types, 
these functions expect and return `experiment()` objects exclusively:

### Core Data Manipulation Functions

| Standard dplyr | Sample Operations | Variable Operations | Magic Power |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `filter()` | `filter_obs()` | `filter_var()` | 🔍 Subset with sync |
| `select()` | `select_obs()` | `select_var()` | 🎯 Choose with protection |
| `arrange()` | `arrange_obs()` | `arrange_var()` | 📊 Sort with order |
| `mutate()` | `mutate_obs()` | `mutate_var()` | ➕ Create with consistency |
| `rename()` | `rename_obs()` | `rename_var()` | 🏷️ Rename with safety |

### Advanced Slicing Functions

| Standard dplyr | Sample Operations | Variable Operations | Specialty |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `slice()` | `slice_obs()` | `slice_var()` | 🔢 Position-based selection |
| `slice_head()` | `slice_head_obs()` | `slice_head_var()` | ⬆️ Top n with sync |
| `slice_tail()` | `slice_tail_obs()` | `slice_tail_var()` | ⬇️ Bottom n with sync |
| `slice_sample()` | `slice_sample_obs()` | `slice_sample_var()` | 🎲 Random with consistency |
| `slice_max()` | `slice_max_obs()` | `slice_max_var()` | 📈 Highest values with order |
| `slice_min()` | `slice_min_obs()` | `slice_min_var()` | 📉 Lowest values with order |

### Joining Functions

| Standard dplyr | Sample Operations | Variable Operations | Magic Power |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| `left_join()` | `left_join_obs()` | `left_join_var()` | Add new columns from another table (left join) |
| `inner_join()` | `inner_join_obs()` | `inner_join_var()` | Add new columns from another table (inner join) |
| `semi_join()` | `semi_join_obs()` | `semi_join_var()` | Filter rows from another table (semi join) |
| `anti_join()` | `anti_join_obs()` | `anti_join_var()` | Filter rows from another table (anti join) |

## Deep Dive: Function-by-Function Examples 🏊‍♂️

Let's explore each function family with hands-on examples!

### Selection: Choosing Your Data Wisely 🎯

```{r}
# Select specific columns from sample info
selected_exp <- select_obs(toy_exp, group, batch)
get_sample_info(selected_exp)
```

```{r}
# Select columns from variable info (notice the index protection!)
var_selected_exp <- select_var(toy_exp, glycan_composition)
get_var_info(var_selected_exp)
```

**Pro tip:** Use `dplyr`-style helpers like `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, and `contains()`:

```{r}
# Select columns starting with "glycan"
helper_exp <- select_var(toy_exp, starts_with("glycan"))
get_var_info(helper_exp)
```

### Arrangement: Putting Things in Order 📊

```{r}
# Arrange samples by batch and group
arranged_exp <- arrange_obs(toy_exp, batch, group)
get_sample_info(arranged_exp)
```

**The magic moment:** 
Check how the expression matrix columns rearranged to match!

```{r}
# Expression matrix columns follow the new sample order
get_expr_mat(arranged_exp)
```

### Mutation: Creating New Insights ➕

```{r}
# Add a new calculated column to sample info
mutated_exp <- mutate_obs(
  toy_exp,
  group_batch = paste(group, batch, sep = "_")
)
get_sample_info(mutated_exp)
```

```{r}
# Create a complexity score for variables
complex_exp <- mutate_var(
  toy_exp,
  complexity = nchar(glycan_composition)
)
get_var_info(complex_exp)
```

### Slicing: Precision Subsetting 🔢

```{r}
# Take the first 2 samples
head_exp <- slice_head_obs(toy_exp, n = 2)
get_sample_info(head_exp)
```

```{r}
# Expression matrix automatically adjusts
get_expr_mat(head_exp)
```

```{r}
# Sample randomly from variables
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility
random_exp <- slice_sample_var(toy_exp, n = 3)
get_var_info(random_exp)
```

### Renaming: Clarity Through Better Names 🏷️

```{r}
# Rename columns in sample info
renamed_exp <- rename_obs(toy_exp, experimental_group = group)
get_sample_info(renamed_exp)
```

**Notice:** The index column "sample" remains untouchable, 
but everything else can be renamed freely!

### Joining: Bridging Tables Together 🔗

These functions can be useful if you have additional information stored in a separate tibble,
and you want to add it to your `experiment()` object.

```{r}
# Join sample info with variable info
more_sample_info <- tibble::tibble(
  sample = c("S1", "S2", "S3", "S4", "S5", "S6"),
  age = c(20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25),
  gender = c("M", "F", "M", "F", "M", "F")
)
joined_exp <- left_join_obs(toy_exp, more_sample_info, by = "sample")
get_sample_info(joined_exp)
```

You might have noticed that we don't have alternatives for `dplyr::right_join()` and `dplyr::full_join()`.
This is because by design joining functions in `glyexp` should only be used to add new information to your `experiment()` object.
However, `right_join()` and `full_join()` will add more observations to the resulting tibbles,
which is not suitable for `experiment()` objects.

For the same reason, the `relationship` parameter is fixed to "many-to-one" for all joining functions in `glyexp`.
You probably don't need to know this, but if you do,
check out the documentation of `dplyr::left_join()` for more details.

## Advanced Patterns: Chaining for Complex Operations 🔗

The real power emerges when you chain multiple operations together. 
Here are some advanced patterns:

### Pattern 1: Filter → Select → Arrange

```{r}
complex_pipeline <- toy_exp |>
  filter_obs(group == "A") |>
  select_obs(group, batch) |>
  arrange_obs(desc(batch)) |>
  filter_var(protein == "PRO1") |>
  select_var(glycan_composition, protein)

print("Final pipeline result:")
print(complex_pipeline)
```

### Pattern 2: Mutate → Filter → Slice

```{r}
analytical_pipeline <- toy_exp |>
  mutate_var(composition_length = nchar(glycan_composition)) |>
  filter_var(composition_length >= 4) |>
  slice_max_var(composition_length, n = 3)

get_var_info(analytical_pipeline)
```

### Pattern 3: Random Sampling for Testing

```{r}
# Create a smaller dataset for testing
set.seed(456)
test_exp <- toy_exp |>
  slice_sample_obs(n = 3) |>
  slice_sample_var(n = 4)

print("Test dataset dimensions:")
print(test_exp)
```

## When dplyr-Style Functions Can't Help: The Escape Hatch 🚪

Sometimes you need functionality that goes beyond what glyexp's dplyr-style functions provide. 
**No problem!** 
Since glyexp's dplyr-style functions **only work with `experiment()` objects**, 
when you need standard dplyr functionality, 
simply extract the tibbles and use any dplyr function you want.

### Why Doesn't glyexp Implement All dplyr Functions? 🤔

**The philosophy is simple:** glyexp only implements functions that **preserve the synchronized multi-table structure** of `experiment()` objects. 

Functions like `count()`, 
`distinct()`, 
`summarise()`, 
and `pull()` return aggregated results that break the original data relationships. 
For these operations, 
extract the relevant tibble and use standard dplyr functions:

```{r}
# For complex aggregations
toy_exp |>
  get_sample_info() |>
  count(group)
```

```{r}
# For distinct values
toy_exp |>
  get_var_info() |>
  distinct(protein) |>
  pull(protein)
```

```{r}
# For advanced filtering with multiple conditions
complex_filter_conditions <- toy_exp |>
  get_sample_info() |>
  filter(group == "A", batch == 2) |>
  pull(sample)

# Then use the results to subset your experiment
filtered_by_complex <- filter_obs(toy_exp, sample %in% complex_filter_conditions)
```

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them ⚠️

### Pitfall 1: Using glyexp Functions on Non-Experiment Objects

**❌ This won't work:**
```{r error=TRUE}
# glyexp functions only work on experiment() objects!
library(tibble)
regular_tibble <- tibble(group = c("A", "B"), value = c(1, 2))
filter_obs(regular_tibble, group == "A")  # Error: not an experiment object!
```

**✅ Do this instead:**
```{r}
# Use regular dplyr functions for regular data structures
regular_tibble <- tibble(group = c("A", "B"), value = c(1, 2))
filter(regular_tibble, group == "A")  # Works perfectly!

# Use glyexp functions only with experiment objects
filtered_exp <- filter_obs(toy_exp, group == "A")  # This works!
get_sample_info(filtered_exp)
```


### Pitfall 2: Forgetting the Synchronization Magic

**❌ Don't do this:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
# This breaks synchronization!
sample_info <- get_sample_info(toy_exp)
filtered_samples <- filter(sample_info, group == "A")
# Now you have filtered sample info but the original expression matrix!
```

**✅ Do this instead:**
```{r}
# This maintains synchronization
filtered_exp <- filter_obs(toy_exp, group == "A")
# Everything stays in sync!
```

### Pitfall 3: Trying to Remove Index Columns

**❌ This won't work as expected:**
```{r error=TRUE}
# Index column protection prevents this - will throw an error!
select_obs(toy_exp, -sample)  
```

**✅ Embrace the protection:**
```{r}
# Select the columns you want, let glyexp protect the index
clean_exp <- select_obs(toy_exp, group, batch)
get_sample_info(clean_exp)
# "sample" column automatically included for data integrity
```

### Pitfall 4: Mismatched Operations

**❌ Don't mix operations inappropriately:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
# This doesn't make sense - you can't arrange sample info by variable properties
arrange_obs(toy_exp, glycan_composition)  # glycan_composition is in var_info!
```

**✅ Use the right function for the right data:**
```{r}
# Arrange variables by their glycan composition
arranged_by_composition <- arrange_var(toy_exp, glycan_composition)
get_var_info(arranged_by_composition)
```

## Performance Considerations: Speed Meets Safety 🏃‍♂️💨

glyexp's dplyr-style functions are designed to be:

**🚀 Fast**: Built on top of highly optimized dplyr functions  
**🛡️ Safe**: Index column protection prevents data corruption  
**🔄 Consistent**: Automatic synchronization eliminates manual errors  

For large datasets, 
consider:

- Filtering early in your pipeline to reduce data size
- Using `select_obs()` and `select_var()` to keep only needed columns
- Chaining operations efficiently to minimize intermediate copies

```{r}
# Efficient pipeline: filter first, then manipulate
efficient_pipeline <- toy_exp |>
  filter_obs(group == "A") |>          # Reduce samples early
  filter_var(protein == "PRO1") |>     # Reduce variables early
  select_obs(group) |>                 # Keep only needed sample columns
  select_var(glycan_composition)       # Keep only needed variable columns
```

## The Philosophy Behind the Design 🧠

glyexp's dplyr-style functions embody a simple but powerful philosophy:

**"Think about your metadata, and let the data follow."** 🎯

This design choice means:

1. **Mental Model Alignment**: You think in terms of samples and variables, not matrix indices
2. **Error Prevention**: Automatic synchronization prevents the most common data analysis mistakes
3. **Familiar Syntax**: If you know dplyr, you already know 90% of glyexp
4. **Composability**: Functions chain together naturally for complex analyses

## Summary 🎯

glyexp's dplyr-style functions are **experiment-specific data manipulators** designed exclusively for `experiment()` objects. 
They provide four key capabilities:

🎼 **Automatic Synchronization** - Operations on metadata automatically update the expression matrix  
🛡️ **Index Column Protection** - Critical relationship columns are protected from deletion  
🔗 **Familiar Syntax** - Standard dplyr operations with multi-table awareness  
🎯 **Type-Aware Operations** - `_obs()` for samples, `_var()` for variables  

**Start simple with `filter_obs()` and `select_var()`, then build complex pipelines!** 🎵
