**🚧 Under Construction Alert!**  
`glyexp` is hot off the press and still evolving rapidly.  
Think of it as your shiny new lab equipment that's being fine-tuned.  
Not quite ready for the big leagues yet, but getting there fast!  
:::

Picture this: you're knee-deep in omics experiments (especially the fascinating world of glycomics and glycoproteomics), 
and you're juggling three types of data like a lab virtuoso:

1. **Expression data** - the actual measurements of your biological molecules (glycans, 
   glycopeptides, 
   and their friends)
2. **Molecular annotations** - the ID cards for your molecules (structures, 
   sequences, 
   you name it)
3. **Experimental metadata** - the story behind your samples (time points, 
   treatments, 
   experimental conditions)

Here's where `glyexp` swoops in to save the day! 🦸‍♀️

The `experiment()` class is your new best friend - think of it as a smart container that keeps all three data types organized and talking to each other. 
No more scattered spreadsheets or lost annotations!

**Why should you care?** Every package in the `glycoverse` ecosystem speaks `experiment()` fluently. 
It's like having a universal translator for your glycomics workflow - everything just *clicks* together.

```{r setup}
library(glyexp)
library(dplyr)
```

## Your First Steps into the Glycoverse

Let's dive in with our trusty toy experiment - think of it as your training wheels before you tackle the real deal.

```{r}
toy_exp <- toy_experiment()
toy_exp
```

Look at that beautiful summary! 
When you print an `experiment()` object, 
it's like getting a snapshot of your entire experimental world - variables, observations, 
and all the metadata that makes your data meaningful.

Now, let's peek under the hood. You can extract the three core components faster than you can say "glycosylation":

### 🧬 The Expression Matrix - Your Data's Heart and Soul

```{r}
get_expr_mat(toy_exp)
```

This matrix is where the magic happens - rows are your variables (molecules), 
columns are your observations (samples), 
and the numbers tell your biological story.

### 🏷️ Variable Information - Meet Your Molecules

```{r}
get_var_info(toy_exp)
```

Think of this as your molecular address book - every variable gets its own detailed profile.

### 📋 Sample Information - Know Your Experiments

```{r}
get_sample_info(toy_exp)
```

And this? 
This is your experimental diary - tracking every condition, timepoint, and treatment.

**Here's the cool part:** Notice how the "variable" column in `get_var_info()` and the "sample" column in `get_sample_info()` perfectly match the row and column names in your expression matrix? 
That's no accident!

These are the **index columns** - the secret sauce that keeps everything synchronized. 
They're like the GPS coordinates that ensure your data stays connected no matter what transformations you throw at it.

## Data Wrangling Made Easy - dplyr Meets glyexp

If you've ever used `dplyr` (and who hasn't?), you're already 90% of the way there! 🎉

For every `dplyr` function you know and love, 
`glyexp` gives you two specialized versions:

- **`_samples()`** functions: work on your sample metadata
- **`_variables()`** functions: work on your variable annotations

Let's see this in action. Want to focus on just group "A" samples?

```{r}
subset_exp <- filter_samples(toy_exp, group == "A")
```

Let's check what happened to our sample info:

```{r}
get_sample_info(subset_exp)
```

Beautiful! But here's where the magic really shines - check out the expression matrix:

```{r}
get_expr_mat(subset_exp)
```

🎪 **Ta-da!** The expression matrix automatically filtered itself to match! 
It's like having a well-trained assistant who anticipates your every move.

This is `filter_samples()` in a nutshell: 
"Hey, filter my sample info this way, and oh yeah, make sure everything else follows suit." 
And it does, flawlessly.

Variable filtering works the same way:

```{r}
toy_exp |>
  filter_samples(group == "A") |>
  filter_variables(glycan_composition == "H5N2") |>
  get_expr_mat()
```

Notice how these functions support the pipe operator (`|>`)? 
That's the `dplyr` DNA in action!

The pattern is simple: `glyexp` functions are just like their `dplyr` cousins, 
but with two superpowers:

1. They expect and return `experiment()` objects (keeping your data ecosystem intact)
2. They treat those index columns like precious cargo (no accidental deletions here!)

## The Sacred Index Columns - Handle with Care

Remember those index columns we mentioned? 
Here's the golden rule: **Don't mess with them directly!** 

Think of them as the foundation of your data house - you can redecorate all you want, 
but don't touch the support beams.

Want to select specific columns from your sample info? Easy:

```{r}
toy_exp |>
  select_samples(group) |>
  get_sample_info()
```

See how the "sample" column (our trusty index) stuck around? 
That's `glyexp` being protective of your data integrity.

Even when you try to be sneaky, it's got your back:

```{r}
toy_exp |>
  select_samples(-starts_with("sample")) |>
  get_sample_info()
```

Nice try, but that index column isn't going anywhere! 😄

## Slicing and Dicing - Matrix-Style Subsetting

Want to subset your experiment? 
Think matrix indexing, but smarter:

```{r}
subset_exp <- toy_exp[, 1:3]
```

This grabs the first 3 samples, and like a good butler, 
updates everything else accordingly:

```{r}
get_expr_mat(subset_exp)
```

```{r}
get_sample_info(subset_exp)
```

Both the expression matrix and sample info are perfectly in sync. It's like they're dancing to the same tune!

## When You Need to Break Free - The Tibble Escape Hatch

The `glycoverse` ecosystem is pretty comprehensive, 
but we know there are times when you need to venture beyond our cozy world. 
When that moment comes, 
`as_tibble()` is your bridge to the broader R universe:

```{r}
as_tibble(toy_exp)
```

This transforms your `experiment()` into a beautiful, 
tidy tibble (what the cool kids call "long format"). 
Every row is an observation, 
every column is a variable - the gold standard for data analysis (see [what is tidy data](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-tidy.html#sec-tidy-data)).

**Pro tip:** These tibbles can get *really* long (think novel-length), 
especially with all that rich metadata. 
Smart analysts filter their experiments first:

```{r}
toy_exp |>
  filter_variables(glycan_composition == "H5N2") |>
  select_samples(group) |>
  select_variables(-glycan_composition) |>
  as_tibble()
```

Much more manageable, right?

## Building Your Own Data Empire 🏗️

Ready to graduate from toy experiments to the real deal? 
Time to build your very own `experiment()` object! 

Think of it like assembling a puzzle - you need three perfect pieces that fit together seamlessly:

🧩 **Piece 1: Expression Matrix** - Your numerical treasure trove  
🧩 **Piece 2: Sample Information** - The story behind each column  
🧩 **Piece 3: Variable Information** - The identity cards for each row  

Once you have these three amigos ready, creating an `experiment()` is as easy as saying "glycosylation"!

```{r}
library(tibble)

# Step 1: Craft your sample story
sample_info <- tibble(
  sample = c("sample1", "sample2", "sample3"),
  group = c("A", "B", "A")
)

# Step 2: Define your molecular cast
var_info <- tibble(
  variable = c("variable1", "variable2", "variable3"),
  glycan_composition = c("H3N2", "H4N2", "H5N2")
)

# Step 3: Generate some exciting (fake) data
expr_mat <- matrix(runif(9, 0, 100), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
rownames(expr_mat) <- var_info$variable
colnames(expr_mat) <- sample_info$sample

# Step 4: The magic moment - bring it all together! ✨
exp <- experiment(
  expr_mat = expr_mat,
  sample_info = sample_info,
  var_info = var_info
)

exp
```

**Voilà!** 🎉 You've just created your first custom `experiment()` object! 
Notice how all the pieces click together perfectly - 
the row names match your variable IDs, 
the column names align with your sample IDs, 
and everything is beautifully synchronized.

**Pro tip:** In real life, 
your expression matrix and variable information might come from a software like [pGlyco3](https://github.com/pFindStudio/pGlyco3),
and your sample info from a separate csv file.
No matter the source, 
as long as those index columns match up, 
`experiment()` will happily bring them together into one harmonious data structure!

**Pro tip again:** If you are using `pGlyco3` or other softwares for glycopeptide identification and quantification,
you can try the [glyread](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyread) package, 
designed to create `experiment()`s from the output of annotation softwares.

## Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

Designing `experiment()` wasn't done in a vacuum - we learned from some amazing predecessors:

**SummarizedExperiment** 📊  
The granddaddy of omics data containers from [Bioconductor](https://github.com/Bioconductor/SummarizedExperiment). 
Solid as a rock for RNA-seq, 
but not quite "tidy" enough for our taste.

**tidySummarizedExperiment** 🧹  
A brilliant attempt to bring tidy principles to SummarizedExperiment from the [tidySummarizedExperiment](https://github.com/stemangiola/tidySummarizedExperiment) package. 
We love the concept, 
but felt that cramming everything into one tibble doesn't quite capture the mental model of separated data types.

**massdataset** 🔬  
Our closest cousin! 
The [massdataset](https://github.com/tidymass/massdataset) package gets so many things right - 
tidy operations, clean data separation, perfect for mass spec data. 
We especially admire its data processing history tracking (reproducibility FTW!). 

But here's our twist: while object-oriented programming has its merits, 
we believe most R users think functionally. 
Your code *is* your reproducibility trail - elegant, transparent, and familiar to every R user.

**Our Philosophy** 💭  
We chose the functional programming path because it feels like home to R users. 
No hidden states, no mysterious transformations - 
just clear, chainable functions that do exactly what they say on the tin.
